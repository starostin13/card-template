## Usage

### Basic Usage

```

### Help

```bash
python card_generator.py --help
```

## JSON Format

The input JSON file should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "title": "Card Title",
      "subtitle": "Optional Subtitle",
      "description": "Main content of the card.\nSupports multiple lines.",
      "footer": "Optional footer text"

  ]
}
```

- 3.5" x 2" dimensions (business card size)
- Rounded corners
- Colored header bar with white title text
- Clean layout with proper spacing
- Professional color scheme

## Translation Rules

When translating Warhammer 40K cards, please follow the guidelines in `TRANSLATION_RULES.md`:

### Quick Reference - DO NOT TRANSLATE:
- ❌ Game phase names (Command phase, Shooting phase, etc.)
- ❌ Game step names (Battle-shock step, Deep Strike, etc.)
- ❌ Words written in ALL CAPS (INFANTRY, VEHICLE, CHARACTER, etc.)
- ❌ Special terms: юнит (unit), модель (model), ТРАНСПОРТ (VEHICLE), ПЕРСОНАЖ (CHARACTER)

### Validation

Check your translations against the rules:

```bash
python validate_translations.py
```

This will verify that:
- Card titles remain in English
- Game phases are not translated
- UPPERCASE terms are preserved
- Special gaming terms follow the convention
